# frog-lens-transmission
This repository contains code and data to reproduce all analyses in: Ecology drives spectral transmission in the ocular lenses of frogs and salamanders (in revision at Functional Ecology). Cloning this repository and running the Rmd scripts from the project file should allow you to rully replicate analyses and figures. 

# Analyses
The Analyses folder contains 1) four Rmd files with code to replicate anlayses and figures; 2) a folder of Final html reports that you can open locally to view code and outputs, 3) a folder of Github readable outputs that you can view (code + outputs_ on GitHub without downloading the repo. 

# Data
This folder contains a subfolder of raw data files (used in the first Rmd analysis file) and a tidy data folder (the outputs of the first Rmd analysis file - a pruned phylogeny and a compiled csv file of lens data and ecological trait data ready for analysis).
